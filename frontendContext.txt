Hitchhike Mobile App – Frontend Prompt
Design and build an interactive, cross-platform mobile application for Hitchhike — a social, reward-driven lift-sharing platform that turns everyday travel into a movement.

The app should feel adventurous, community-driven, and rewarding. Prioritize smooth, gesture-based transitions and fluid animations using Framer Motion or Reanimated. The experience should mimic exploration — playful but purposeful.

Use a visually bold and unconventional color palette — think deep ochre, matte teal, cosmic navy, or sun-faded coral. Avoid generic white/blue themes. The app should feel like a traveler’s passport, not a ride-hailing dashboard.

The UI must be fully responsive, mobile-first, and include:

Welcome + Onboarding screens with swipeable info

Role-based login (Pilot or Hitchhiker) with Firebase Auth

Live Map screen with animated pins and real-time ride data

Reward Dashboard showing progress toward brand-sponsored perks

Ride Cards and Profile Pages with storytelling vibes

Custom Role Toggle Switch and Notification Badges

Use Tailwind-like styling via NativeWind and build modular UI components (Button, Card, Modal). Navigation should be stack-based, with optional bottom tabs for major sections (Home, Rewards, Profile).
